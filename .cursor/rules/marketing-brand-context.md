## Problem Statement

### For Players

- **Limited Access:** Elite coaching and feedback is expensive and geographically restricted
- **No Visibility:** Talented players in smaller markets have no pathway to get noticed
- **Inconsistent Training:** Self-training without feedback leads to bad habit formation
- **No Benchmarking:** Players can't objectively measure their progress or compare to peers

### For Coaches

- **Scalability Issues:** Can't provide individual feedback to every player outside training sessions
- **Manual Tracking:** Player progress tracking is subjective and time-consuming
- **Limited Insights:** Lack of data on player performance outside structured training
- **Communication Overhead:** Difficulty assigning and tracking homework/drills

### For Scouts

- **Geographic Limitations:** Can only scout players they can physically watch
- **Inefficient Discovery:** Attending countless games to find few prospects
- **Subjective Assessment:** Limited objective data for comparison
- **Missing Talent:** Great players in remote areas go undiscovered

### Market Opportunity

- 265+ million active soccer players globally
- Youth soccer market valued at $20B+ annually
- Growing demand for sports tech and analytics
- Underserved market for grassroots-level AI coaching
